# diy_hifi_amplifier

Hopefully, this will be my DIY HiFi amplifier built for passive analog speaker as a hobby project 

For now, the project contains:
Power amplifier which is entirely based on Douglas Self's "Audio Power Amplifier Design" handbook, is based on his blameless methodology.
It produces 50 watts into 8 ohms at 1 Vrms input with a THD of 0.003%

The readme will be updated as the project progresses
