This is transformer considerations for the unregulated powersupply built for supplying the power amplifier for the project

230VAC primary, 50VAC 2 secondary 200VA rated transformer

Notes: Could fit the project however the rails are going to be higher than required and then the amplifier can draw more than the rated power unless a fuse is put in place or some other form of current limiting in the amplifier. Dont know about if it can tolerate the current drawn by the amplifier 

230VAC primary, 50VAC 2 secondary 200VA rated transformer

Notes: Cheaper than the one above and seem to have the same specs.

230VAC primary, 30VAC 2 secondary 200VA rated transformer

Notes: this can deliver enough current them rails may just be too little especially after rectification.

230VAC primary, 20VAC 2 secondary 200VA rated transformer
https://dk.rs-online.com/web/p/chassismonterede-transformere/0503956
Notes: could get two of these and wire them in series to create 40VAC, expensive solution though.

230VAC primary, 35VAC 2 secondary 300VA rated transformer

Notes: this could be the transformer for the project good price aswell.
